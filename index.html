      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I spent the last four years working in adult education, and am now
        looking to make a career change into web developmet. Other than that, I
        particularly enjoy cooking, learning languages, and making use of my
        state park pass whenever I can.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        I'm from the Midwest, specifically from a small town east of St. Paul.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        Some of my favorite hobbies include cooking and baking (I love fresh
        bread!), hiking, learning (spoken) languages and, more recently I'm
        beginning to develop a passion for coding.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        My dream job would be working with or alongside a team of computational
        linguists to help advance natural language processing and voice
        recognition as they concern non-native speakers of English.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        Currently I'm still living in the Twin Cities metro area, but I hope to
        move to--and find a job in--Denver, Colorado after completing this
        program.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I love learning in general, and after 2020, I felt it was a good time to
        make a career change and learn a new skillset. In addition, I've found
        that I very much enjoy the trial and error process - the more errors
        made, the more satisfying the solution.
